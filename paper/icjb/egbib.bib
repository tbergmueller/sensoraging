   abstract = {New pixel defects occurring in imaging sensors during their lifetime provide valuable forensics information. This study shows how such defects can be used in estimating acquisition time of images originated from digital cameras. While photo response non-uniformity noise has been used for camera identification thanks to its strong stability over time, pixel defects can occur suddenly, for example as a consequence of cosmic radiation. In this work, we model pixel defects as abrupt changes in parameterized model of pixels response. We describe a maximum-likelihood estimator of sensor defects separated into photo-response non-uniformity, dark current, and pixel offset before and after the defect occurs. Then we demonstrate that such estimators can be successfully used to place an image of unknown acquisition time among n other images whose acquisition time is known. Estimation errors depend on n and the frequency of defects occurrences.}

	Abstract = {We are undoubtedly living in an age where we are exposed to a remarkable array of visual imagery. While we may have historically had confidence in the integrity of this imagery, today's digital technology has begun to erode this trust. From the tabloid magazines to the fashion industry, main-stream media outlets, scientific journals, political campaigns, courtrooms, and the photo hoaxes that land in our email in-boxes, doctored photographs are appearing with a growing frequency and sophistication. Over the past five years, the field of digital forensics has emerged to help return some trust to digital images. Here I review the state of the art in this new and exciting field.},

@article{12696519,
	Abstract = {Photo-response non-uniformity (PRNU) of digital sensors was recently proposed [1] as a unique identification fingerprint for digital cameras. The PRNU extracted from a specific image can be used to link it to the digital camera that took the image. Because digital camcorders use the same imaging sensors, in this paper, we extend this technique for identification of digital camcorders from video clips. We also investigate the problem of determining whether two video clips came from the same camcorder and the problem of whether two differently transcoded versions of one movie came from the same camcorder. The identification technique is a joint estimation and detection procedure consisting of two steps: (1) estimation of PRNUs from video clips using the Maximum Likelihood Estimator and (2) detecting the presence of PRNU using normalized cross-correlation. We anticipate this technology to be an essential tool for fighting piracy of motion pictures. Experimental results demonstrate the reliability and generality of our approach.},
